> From Tandem NonStop, through Business Intelligence, till Ruby on Rails  
> More adventure awaits ahead.

A Civil Engineer by qualification, I started my career in software in 1999.

Worked in Tandem NonStop platform for 6 years, COBOL, Pathway, TAL, C and all.

Stepped into a world of Data Warehousing and Business intelligence through a BI/DW project on Tandem.

All along I have been creating web applications, and scripting using shell scripts, Perl, Python and Ruby. Recently I moved on to build web applications using Ruby on Rails.
